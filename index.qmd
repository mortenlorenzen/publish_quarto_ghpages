title: "GitHub Actions"

This is a sandbox Quarto website with GitHub Actions to:

- run R code within Quarto on Github
- publish a Quarto website on GitHub Pages


Use cases:

- run R scrips remotely and document when the code has been executed
- produce and publish a report automatically on a schedule


With GitHub Actions on GitHub I can:

- install Quarto + R and the correct versions of each R package you need (yml file)
- render a Quarto project (not render any files locally!) (yml file)
- publish a Quarto project on GitHub Pages (yml file)
- execute R code and content in `qmd` files
