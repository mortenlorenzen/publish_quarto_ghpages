# Run R code on GitHub

This is a test website to run R code within Quarto on Github and publish a Quarto website to document when the code has been executed. Link: [mortenlorenzen.github.io/publish_quarto_ghpages/](https://mortenlorenzen.github.io/publish_quarto_ghpages/)

With GitHub Actions on GitHub:

- install Quarto + R and the correct versions of each R package you need
- render a Quarto project (not render any files locally!)
- publish a Quarto project on GitHub Pages
- Execute R code and content in `qmd` files
