Here is my Workflow for a Quarto website using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions.

Workflow - setting things up:

1. Create Quarto website project with git and renv in RStudio on my Mac.
1. Commit with Sourcetree ??
1. Create  my new repository on GitHub with `usethis::use_github()` in RStudio in my R project (My GitHub token used in `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` controls which GitHub account is used)
1. On GitHub in my new repository: main -> View all branches -> Create a branch -> "gh-pages"
1. Create txt file `publish.yaml` file in new folders `.github/workflows`. Copy/paste [complete example of a GitHub Action 1.(https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#example-knitr-with-renv) into `publish.yaml`
1. (notice that I have not rendered locally at all)
1. Commit with Sourcetree
1. Push to GitHub in in RStudio
1. On GitHub in my new repository: 
   - Pages -> Branch -> change from "main" to "gh-pages" and save
   - Top bar -> Actions, - here I can follow the "pages build and deployment" and then I go to visit the website


Workflow:

1. Write R code and content in `qmd` files
1. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of your project library in `renv.lock`
1. Commit with Sourcetree
1. Push to GitHub in in RStudio
1. From here GitHub Actions runs automatically. It
   - runs the R code
   - renders the Quarto website
   - publishes the Quarto website on GitHub Pages
